To create and remember passwords for online services, the best practice for
most folks online is to use a password management tool such as `Bitwarden
<https://bitwarden.com/>`_ to generate long, cryptographically random
passwords. Then, a very strong passphrase is used to lock the password manager.

Unfortunately, in a misguided attempt to encourage users to choose better
passwords, many websites and apps enforce `restrictive password policies <https://github.com/duffn/dumb-password-rules>`_.
These policies inhibit users from using cryptographically random
password generators: a long, high-entropy password is more likely to
violate such rules, which means a security-savvy user may have to attempt
several "random" passwords before one is accepted. This punishes users
who are trying to follow best practices.

Enter dumbpw. dumbpw allows you to configure a set of rules, and then it will
generate a cryptographically secure password that conforms to those dumb rules.

If all you need is a password generator, **you should not use this**.

Installation
------------

.. code-block :: console

    pip3 install dumbpw

Usage
-----

.. code-block :: console

    $ dumbpw --help
    Usage: dumbpw [OPTIONS] LENGTH

    Options:
    --version                       Show the version and exit.
    --min-uppercase INTEGER         The minimum number of uppercase characters.
    --min-lowercase INTEGER         The minimum number of lowercase characters.
    --min-digits INTEGER            The minimum number of digit characters.
    --min-specials INTEGER          The minimum number of special characters.
    --blocklist TEXT                Characters that may not be in the password.
                                    [default: '";]

    --specials TEXT                 Non-alphanumeric characters that may be in
                                    the password. Pass '-' to read from standard

Known issues
------------
* dumbpw uses `secrets <https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html>`_
  to generate passwords. If the generated string doesn't meet the given
  requirements, dumbpw discards it and generates another, until one passes.
  Therefore, if you ask dumbpw to generate a long password with high minimums,
  it will run for a very long time before terminating.
* Likewise, if your minimums require characters that are banned in the
  blocklist option, dumbpw will run forever.
* The author is neither a cryptographer, nor a security expert. There has
  been no formal, independent, external security review of this software. As
  explained in the LICENSE, the author assumes no responsibility or liability

Development
============

To install development dependencies, you will need `poetry <https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/>`_
and `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_.

.. code-block :: console

    pre-commit install --install-hooks
    poetry install && poetry shell

`direnv <https://direnv.net/>`_ is optional, but recommended for convenience.
